				<h3 class="center">About Steven</h3>
				<p class="center">
					Steven has been able to program since the age of 8 when he learned to disassemble Playstation One games in order to alter game functions (without realising it until he studied computer science). He learned to build his first computer at the same age, and shortly after learned basic electronics. Over his teenage years, he refined and honed these skills. When Steven left school, he accepted private client work and developed frontend applications for local businesses. He continued to do this until he studied law, when he became active in public policy work arising out of personal sentiment to critical public policy issues. From here, he developed a keen interest in criminal and public law. He furthered this when he studied computer science, later leading to an Honorary Research Fellowship and a Lectureship. That insight into the law and his passion for computer science is what acted as a springboard for his specialism in cybersecurity and secure software development.

				<h3>Scientific Work</h3>
				<p>
					Steven is an experienced fullstack secure software develop and DevOps engineer, with years of commercial experience. His work in computer science centres around "zero trust". His research focuses on a theory he devised known as the "cardinal trust" model. This model asks the fundamental question of whether it is possible to have a functioning computer system in which no aspect of the underlying infrastructure, the data or the users of the computer system are trusted. The motivation for this theoretical undertaking was the serious security breaches which have recently occurred such as WannaCry in the NHS, the OPM security breach, the Equifax breach, PRISM and many more secure breaches that ask questions at the core of modern society's reliance on computer technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					He is a lecturer at the Manchester Metropolitan University teaching cybersecurity, computer science and technology law as it relates to computer science. His research activities are continued as part of an Honorary Research Fellowship in which he contributes significantly to the state of the art in cybersecurity, publishing in major academic journals, books and conferences as part of his contribution to academia.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h4>Key Achievements</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Steven continues to work in the industry as DevOps Engineer in employment and as a Fullstack Developer accepting private client work for major international clients and high value national projects. He also provides expertise advise, translating best practice from computer science to other industries.<br><br></li>

					<li>Developed the state of the art significantly as it relates to zero trust security, unprivileged and trustless computing. He presently investigates ways of improving industrial practice to allow for guaranteed security and distributed computing applications which work effectively every time.<br><br></li>

					<li>Created the Atlas.io PAAS software which implements the trustless model on a mass scale. It allows developers to launch payloads without having to be concerned with the security of the underlying platform. Amateur developers and non-programmers	are able to use it to acheive security by default which prevents wider consequent security risks.<br><br></li>

					<li>Contributes significantly to the opensource community, particularly in encouraging the uptake of cybersecurity best practices, secure software development and effective DevOps implementations which respect agile requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of security that protects not just that user, but the wider internet community.<br><br><br><br></li>

				<h3>Legal Work</h3>
				<p>
					Steven presently provides the government with advice on law reform related to technology law, national security as it relates to cybersecurity and children's safety on the internet. Most recently, he advised the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy in relation to its wide-ranging review of cybersecurity of critical national infrastructure. He also advised Parliament in relation to the present national security capability of the United Kingdom in responding to cybersecurity threats. He continues to be involved in legal reform relating to data privacy, the protection of children in cyberspace and best practices flowing from computer science academia into legislation.
				</p>
				<p>
					He has contributed significantly to the state of the law, particularly in regards to the legislation concerning child sexual offences. He has experience of public, criminal and family law. During the sequence of public inquiries related to sexual grooming in the United Kingdom, Steven coordinated evidence in key public inquiries and led a private inquiry into the performance of public bodies. He is also regularly involved in unduly lenient sentence referrals under s.36 Criminal Justice Act
					1988 as regards the correctness and scope of judicial power in passing sentence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Steven has significant experience of teaching law to professional lawyers and law students in both practice environments and university environments. His teaching efforts are supplemented heavily by his contributions to the law.

				<h4>National Security</h4>
				<p>Steven regularly provides expert advice to Parliament and Her Majesty's Government on national security matters related to computer science and cybersecurity. He also contributes to the development of opensource software and initiatives that provide wider access to the tools needed to avert national security threats at the very foundation. He works as part of an interdisciplinary team to ensure that expertise is delivered to the right places in right way.

				<h4>Unduly Lenient Sentence Referrals</h4>
				<p>He has a keen interest in ensuring cases are referred to the to the Law Officers (the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General) under the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme (that is the government machinery for s.36 Criminal Justice Act 1988) where there is doubt about whether a sentence was appropriate for the nature of the offence for which a given conviction was made. It takes only one referral under the scheme for the law officers to be required to review a prosecution case.</p>
