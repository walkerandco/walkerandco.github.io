                <p class="center">
                    Steven has been able to program since the age of 8 when he learned to disassemble Playstation One games in order to alter game functions. He learned to build his first computer at the same age, and shortly after learned basic electronics. Over his teenage years, he refined and honed these skills. When Steven left school, he studied children's nursing whilst working part-time for the social services. He worked in the health and social care industry for 5 years in children's critical care before developing a special interest in child safeguarding. During his legal studies, he took part in major public policy work in relation to child sexual exploitation, particularly by grooming gangs and offences committed using the internet (cyber CSE offences). From here, he developed a keen interest in criminal and public law. That insight into criminal law and his passion for computer science is what acted as a springboard for his specialism in cybersecurity.

                <h3>Scientific Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Steven's work in computer science revolves around "zero trust" otherwise described as "unprivileged computing". His research focuses on a theory he devised known as the "cardinal trust" model. This model allows computer scientists to remove situational awareness when designing computer systems which makes them very difficult, if not impossible, to penetrate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key motivation for designing and researching an unprivileged computing model was to deal with increasing threats from persons in a position of trust inside a computer network and the increasing use of computers as digital weapons both by criminals and nation states. His legal experience was crucial in creating a system which truly protects resources and assets in accordance with regulatory requirements.

                <ol>
                    <li>Developed the "cardinal trust" model of unprivileged or "zero trust" computing which provides a way of removing situational awareness to make computer systems incredibly robust.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Created the Atlas.io PAAS software which implements the cardinal trust model on a mass scale. It allows developers to launch payloads without having to be concerned with the security of the underlying platform. Amateur developers and non-programmers are able to use it to acheive security by default.</li>

                <h3>Legal Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Steven has contributed significantly to the state of the law, particularly in regards to the legislation concerning child sexual offences. He has experience of public, criminal and family law. During the sequence of public inquiries related to sexual grooming in the United Kingdom, Steven coordinated evidence in key public inquiries and led a private inquiry into the performance of public bodies. He is also regularly involved in unduly lenient sentence referrals under s.36 Criminal Justice Act 1988 as regards the correctness and scope of judicial power in passing sentence. His family law experience stems directly from working with vulnerable families seeking escape from serious violence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having represented hundreds of victims of sexual offences to the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2012 during its inquiry into Localised Grooming and Child Sexual Exploitation, Steven has developed a track record of defending the rights of vulnerable women. He then developed this further by providing representation for those in danger as a result of escalating domestic violence, this through the National Centre for Domestic Violence. This was supplemented by pro bono legal advice and representation in local advice centres in the areas of housing, insolvency, family, consumer and welfare law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steven has significant experience of teaching law to professional lawyers and law students in both practice environments and university environments. His teaching efforts are supplemented heavily by his contributions to the law.

                <p><em>If your request for legal help or otherwise falls into one the categories below, I might be able to help. If not, I may be able to help you find the right person or place to assist you with your specific needs. I am usually instructed through a partner organisation as <u>I am not an authorised person under the Legal Services Act 2007</u> and so require permission in each case where I am asked to directly represent a person in a Court or Tribunal. I am also frequently asked to provide academic advice in complex cases.</em>

                <h4>Unduly Lenient Sentence Referrals</h4>
                <p>On a day-to-day basis, I either recruit cases or have them referred to me, in respect of unduly lenient sentences passed in Crown Courts residing in England or Wales. Naturally, the sentences which come to me flow out of extremely serious criminal cases; usually sexual offence cases. When these cases come to me, provided they are potentially unduly lenient, I refer them to the Law Officers (the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General) under the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme (that is the government machinery for s.36 Criminal Justice Act 1988). It takes only one referral under the scheme for the law officers to be required to review a prosecution case.</p>
                <p>I draft the Grounds of Appeal and send them to the Attorney-General''s Office. Once my appeal has been considered in respect of a case, one of the Law Officers will write to me, informing me whether he has found the sentence to be unduly lenient or not. If a sentence is unduly lenient in the view of a Law Officer, it can then be referred to the Court of Appeal under s.36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The Court of Appeal then have an opportunity to review the case on submissions of appeal. They will then dismiss the appeal, allow the appeal and change the sentence (based on double-jeopardy principle) or allow the appeal but leave the sentence to stand.</p>
                <h4>Public Policy Work</h4>
                <p>I have a specific interest in ensuring victims of sexual abuse are represented in the on-going public inquiries. I would be happy to assist any victims in articulating their evidence or to take part in these inquiries. Please contact me for assistance in that regard.</p>
                <h4>Emergency Injunction Orders for Domestic Violence</h4>
                <p>In respect of victims of Domestic Violence, I am able to be instructed through the National Centre for Domestic Violence. I can either act as a McKenzie friend for litigants in person, or I can provide supervised representation. I can then attend a return date hearing with clients to assist them with their case when confronted by their potential abuser.</p>
                <h4>General Civil Litigation</h4>
                <p>For housing, employment, debt, harassment, family and consumer matters I am able to provide advice, direction or representation through channel organisations. Please enquire to find out more.</p>
